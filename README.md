## Inspiration
This project is based on the second prompt for the hackathon. Our goal is to implement a calendar which removes the conflicts with the exam schedules that any university student might have.

This is a common problem that most of the university students tackle in their day-to-day lives, and our project targets to help them resolve all the conflicts easily and effectively.

## What it does
The app allows professors to manage time conflicts when scheduling exams because students might have conflicting exam timings with other courses.

## How we built it
The project was built with React, and AWS amplify which allowed us to publish our application to the web as well as access APIs such as AWS bedrock and Voiceflow.

## Challenges we ran into
One of the main challenges that our team ran into was the time constraint. Having to create a project in such a fast paced environment required us to make a lot of tradeoffs such as how much time to allocate to the front end vs learning the AWS services. We also had issues with GitHub, but these were thankfully resolved and allowed us to better learn how to collaborate using the platform.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud that we were able to create an AWS application during such a short hackathon.

## What we learned
We learnt to implement latest cloud technologies from AWS into our project This also one of our main challenges because we had to learn a new technology and use it in a very short amount of time.

## What's next for Counter Conflict
For future developments we would like to further develop our web application to be more integrated with full stack features. These would include having availability of professors be recorded on DynamoDB using our schedule page and interactive calendar. AWS bedrock will also be implemented to optimize these recorded schedules using LLMâ€™s for creating a schedule that does not have overlapping tests. A student version would also be needed to avoid having overwhelming exam schedules.
